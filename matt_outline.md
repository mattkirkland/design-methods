### INTRO
IE, Matt's basics. check ACM toolkit presentation

- UX intro, JJG diagram, etc.  
- Set up basic framework: Research, Design, Test, Design, Test.
- DON NORMAN STUFF (feedback, affordances, mental models, mapping) (that's probably 2, 3, 4?)
  - see https://www.sharritt.com/CISHCIExam/norman.html
- GESTALT PRINCIPLES (please say they know them)
- Empathy / Contempt
- error protection / recovery

### Research & Synthesis (most of these methods can also be used to test your designs!)

Why research???? (erika hall!)

Who ARE the users you're targeting?

Ethnographic
- desirepath/annotations etc (see how / where users try to fix or annotate things in real life) (UM 92)  
- graffiti walls (UM 45) (mk for cowards)
- interest groups (find the subreddit, join a knitting circle)
- contextual inquiry
- literature / niche reading
- ethnography / (UM 27)"design ethnography"
- diary studies
- ergonomic data / analysis (UM 33)
- human factors! (cogsci )
- interviews - UM 48
- 1.2 popular media scan (read the internet)
- 2.12 SME interview
- 4.15 user groups definition (basically real-people-driven personas)
- behavioral mapping (UM: '06')

Participatory- imagining new or talking about the past
- focus group (UM 43)
- buy a feature
- affinity mapping / card sort
- surveys (likert, etc)
  - semantic differential (UM 75), etc
- crowdsource / mechanical turk
- love letter / breakup letter (UM 54)

Evaluative - evaluating or synthesizing what you've learned
- heuristic analysis
- task analysis (UM 84), related to Contextual inquiry
- mental model diagram (UM 55)  
- content analysis / inventory (????) probably not, this is a whole field
- brainstorming / graphic organizers / mind maps / that kind of BS
  - mind mapping (UM 56)
- 2.7 Analogous Models
- 2.8 Competitors / Complementors
- benchmarking / competitive testing (UM: 15)
- critique
- system usability scale


### Designing

How to arrange these?  low-fidelity to high, perhaps.

Talking About it
- swimlane diagrams (UM 72)
- 5.4 Persona definition
- user story
- 4.17 user journey mapping (UM 95)
- moodboard / brandboard

Making it
- storyboards
- thumbnail sketch
- wireframes  
- sketch prototype
- cardboard mockup / paper prototype
- internet prototype
- wizard of oz prototype
- participatory design (UM 61)
- video scenario
- video prototype
- pitch / commercial / cover story / etc
- design tiles
- generative design (ie, nervous system, Machine learning, etc?)
- mockups

### Testing

Usability Testing
- guerilla usability study (task based, always!)
- wizard of oz prototype
- formal usability studies
  - think aloud protocol
- structured usability study
- lab usablity studies
- remote user testing
- heuristic analysis
- system usability scale

Data-Driven
- ab tests
- data driven usage / google analytics / (universal methods: '05 automated remote research'), wistia video heatmap, etc.  
- eye-tracking (viz as heatmap or pathways) (UM 40)
- click tracking (like eye)

Talking About it
- post-study interviews
- focus group
- group critique
- surveys (likert, etc)
  - semantic differential (UM 75), etc

- 7.4 Pilot Plans

### BONUS ROUND
Design Ethics

- victor papanek,
- E F Schumacher, small is beautiful
- monteiro, ruined by design
