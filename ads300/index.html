              <h1>Welcome</h1>
              <p>This course is an overview of user experience design and its methods; we'll look at the fundamental principles and methods underlying the interactions between people, artifacts, and systems. We will survey the landscape of design methodologies available in the world that you can apply to all of your design projects.</p>
              <p>That sounds a bit formal, but really we can think of this as an introduction to a <strong>bag of tools</strong> that you can use when you're tackling any kind of design project.</p>
              <p>Design mockups are a hammer. Let's talk about calipers. Angle Grinders. Voltmeters.  Geiger counters. Excavators.</p>
              <p>The course will be primarily lecture and reading, but you'll also have a chance to try out a few methods that sound interesting to you and put them into practice.</p>

              <p>This syllabus site will have all the resources you'll need for the class, and will be updated regularly throughout the semester.</p>

              <h2>Course Overview</h2>

              <h3>Who this course is for</h3>

              <p>This course is for undergraduate designers in ID, Viscom, and other fields within KU's School of Design. You might be a sophomore or junior. You want to design <em>stuff</em> for <em>people</em> to <em>use</em>.</p>

              <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
              <p>When this course is complete, you'll have a new toolbox of ways to approach a design project. You'll have broad familiarity with specific user-centered design practices, some experience using some of them, and most importantly you'll have an idea of when it's appropriate to use what kind of tool.</p>

              <h3>What we'll do</h3>
              <p>Each week we'll tackle a content area covering the basics of UX and design methods. There will be a short lecture, with some readings and video links for more details. Each week you'll get a little practice using some of those methods, and record it in an ongoing project notebook.</p>

              <h3>Schedule</h3>
              <p>We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, at 4pm via Zoom. See the full <a href="#schedule">Schedule for details</a>.</p>

              <h3>Your Notebook</h3>
              <p>You're going to keep a digital notebook as you test out these design methods. You'll choose a pet project to work on throughout the semester, and each week you'll record findings about the methods you try out. You'll write briefly about what you learned and document the process.</p>
