# design-methods
Seminar course on design methods.  Pitched by üêö üé∫ in mid-spring 2020.

This course is an overview of design methods; it's targeted to be primarily lecture and demonstration. We will survey the landscape of design methodologies to apply to your design projects. That sounds kind of formal, but really this is an introduction to a bag of tools you can use when you're tackling any kind of design project.

Design mockups are a hammer. Let's talk about calipers. Voltmeters. Excavators.

## Who this course is for

This course is for undergraduate designers in ID, Viscom, and other fields within KU's School of Design. You might be a sophomore or junior. You want to design stuff for people.

## What you'll learn

When this course is complete, you'll have a new toolbox of ways to approach a design project. You'll have broad familiarity with specific user-centered design practices, some experience using some of them, and most importantly you'll have an idea of when it's appropriate to use what kind of tool.

## What we'll do

Each week we'll tackle a content area covering the basics of UX and design methods. Each week you'll get a little practice using some of those methods.

## Your Notebook

You're going to keep a digital notebook as you test out these design methods. You'll choose a pet project to work on throughout the semester, and each week you'll record findings about the methods you try out. You'll write briefly about what you learned and document the process. <a href="notebook.md">See more about your Notebook and what we'll do there here.</a>

## Grading

Most weeks will have a single assignment, which will happen in your Notebook. Each week you'll get completion points based on if you have actually done the assignment and it's ready on time.

We'll also have a final exam that covers the big ideas and methods discussed over the semester.

Your grade will be 80% Notebook completion, 20% Final Exam.

## Deadlines

Your assignments are **always due at 8:00am on Monday mornings**. You'll turn in your assignments by having them in your Notebook online.

## Office Hours

I will be available for 1-1 meetings over zoom or equivalent as needed - email me!  Otherwise I will be available for an extended time on Tuesdays after our class.
