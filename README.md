# design-methods
Seminar course on design methods.  

This course is an overview of design methods; it's targeted to be primarily lecture and demonstration. We will survey the landscape of design methodologies to apply to your design projects. That sounds kind of formal, but really this is an introduction to a bag of tools you can use when you're tackling any kind of design project.

Design mockups are a hammer. Let's talk about calipers. Voltmeters. Excavators.

## Who this course is for

This course is for undergraduate designers in ID, Viscom, and other fields within KU's School of Design. You might be a sophomore or junior. You want to design stuff for people.

## What you'll learn

When this course is complete, you'll have a new toolbox of ways to approach a design project. You'll have broad familiarity with specific user-centered design practices, some experience using them, and most importantly you'll have an idea of when it's appropriate to use what kind of tool.

TODO:
- start planning a class structure.  
  - talkshow/gameshow format: 10 minutes of X, then 20 minute segment of Y, segment of Z, etc.
X - list of design methods
  X - survey some books
  X - start here too: https://www.designkit.org/methods#filter
X - how to make this studio-like but not a studio course.
  X - how can students test out these methodologies?
  X - we don't need to grade their effectiveness, we just need to verify that the students tried out the method.
X - go thru LUMA book
X - go thru universal methods book
X - organize methods-to-cover.md into logical groups!
X - comb thru outline.md and put into matt_outline.md
X - comb thru the IDEO list in design-methods-list.md
