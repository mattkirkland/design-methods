# design-methods
Seminar course on design methods.  

This course is an overview of design methods; it's targeted to be primarily lecture and demonstration. We will survey the landscape of design methodologies to apply to your design projects. That sounds kind of formal, but really this is an introduction to a bag of tools you can use when you're tackling any kind of design project.   

Design mockups are a hammer. Let's talk about calipers. Voltmeters. Excavators.

## Who this course is for

This course is for undergraduate designers in ID, Viscom, and other fields within KU's School of Design. You might be a sophomore or junior. You want to design stuff for people.

## What you'll learn

When this course is complete, you'll have a new toolbox of ways to approach a design project. You'll have broad familiarity with specific user-centered design practices, some experience using them, and most importantly you'll have an idea of when it's appropriate to use what kind of tool. 

## Matt's ongoing notes

Note 3/20/20: Amy Ko's got a book online here that looks great. It's even on github!
https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/index.html
I really like this outline AND it's well written; this might be a great framing for the course. https://github.com/amyjko/design-methods

Note 5/13/20: Just putting it in writing that this course plan will need to be structured for online delivery as well as an in-person lecture hall.

Note 6/15/20: Confirmed by Jeremy Shellhorn, likely plan for this to be all online.  How do we make it engaging and useful?

- can they tackle a personal project and apply these tools to a single project all the way through? MAYBE?
- can we allow all their work to be submitted and tracked online? yes

Title lectures / components with outcomes and new skills in mind. What is a student going to GET out of this?

TODO:
- start planning a class structure.
  - talkshow/gameshow format: 10 minutes of X, then 20 minute segment of Y, segment of Z, etc.
- list of design methods
  - survey some books
  - start here too: https://www.designkit.org/methods#filter
- how to make this studio-like but not a studio course.
  - how can students test out these methodologies?
  - we don't need to grade their effectiveness, we just need to verify that the students tried out the method.
