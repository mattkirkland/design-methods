# Your Notebook

Throughout the semester you're going to compile a design notebook. Think of this like a design playground, or a Lab Workbook, or a Design Diary! This will be a place to reflect on the week's activity and write about testing out the new UX design methods.

We'll make a shared spreadsheet with everyone's links, or post them here.

Your notebook is a chance to practice working in public; the stakes couldn't be lower. Your notebook URL will be shared with the class and so we can learn from each other's experiences testing out UX design methods. It should also be a nice 'practice' case study for your portfolio: any employer will be impressed to see you think through a single problem using a bunch of different methods, and documenting your process.

## Your Project

The Notion Notebook / Lab Workbook / Design Diary / Etc. is a diary of developing your Pet Project. The Pet Project can be anything, as:

- it has an identifiable group of users (that aren't you)
- and you're willing to think about it for a semester.

That means it could be anything you're interested in. It could be:

- a better organizational system for your pokemon cards
- a book review site that's for a closed circle of friends
- a new app to guide museum visitors around the Spencer
- a refrigerated case for your fancy cheese collection
- a bag to organize knitting supplies
- a series of posters to convince people to take some political action
- wayfinding signage for your favorite sports facility / museum / campus
- a guidebook to teach others how to make protest infrastructure
- that board game you've been wanting to make

It doesn't have to be a NEW idea or something that's never been done. It just needs to be interesting (to YOU) and have a set of potential *users* that it could serve. (You can't do User Experience design without *users.*)

**An important note** about designing your project: we don't really care so much what the final design of your project might look like - in fact, we won't even get to a state where we'll call it 'final.' Instead, **we only care about process** - this Notebook is a *playground* to test out design methods.

Choose your project before or during WEEK 2. **You should know it by September 3.**

## Format

Your notebook is going to be completed in <a href="#">Notion</a>, an online note-taking / publishing system. You can use the free version, which makes it really easy to take notes and publish your pages. This is used by a growing number of designers and especially people in the digital world. At the end of the semester, you can export this out of notion and

Here's a template. You can go here and duplicate this notebook to get started.

A few weeks will have specific prompts to fill out when we cover special topics. In the other ones, you'll follow this format.

- Pick a UX design method we
- Try it out on your pet project
- Document it! write up what you did
 - What I did
 - What I learned
 - What I was suprised by
 - What I'd do next time
 - etcetera

## Getting Started

Start your Notebook by <a href="https://www.notion.so/WEEK-1-Getting-Started-be68f94a1707445b80e2b117041754b0">clicking here to see the Example Notebook</a>.  You can click the 'duplicate' option to clone that example and use it.

- Fill out the first page and customize it
- Find the sharing settings for your notebook and make sure it's public
- <a href="https://forms.gle/ZXSWPTZjKbbs8bEF9">Fill out this form to tell us the URL of your notebook.</a>
- When you're ready, fill out the About My Project page

## Grading

You'll get graded only on completing each week's assignment in the Notebook. Did you have this completed by 8am on Monday? You get full credit. Done = full points. Not done = no points. Late = no points.

### Make-ups

If you miss a week in your Notebook - or if it's late and therefore don't get credit - you can make it up by doing a book report. You can select from the list of books: read it, write it up as a new page in your Notebook and send the link to me.

pick out a pet design project, and write a 'lab notebook' in Notion. It can be a place they reflect on the week's activity and write about testing out some method on their project.

By the end of the semester they'll have an overview of a bunch of new methods they have learned about and tested, and written about.
It could be a great portfolio piece? Plus they can export it to HTML, PDF, text.

STRONGLY leaning to this.
Then Me and a TA (if any) can just check the lab notebook each week and just mark yes/no if they've done the work. I... kind of love it?  Done = full points. Not done = no points. Late = no points.

Pat recommends: they'll definitely need a prompt to help some students get started.

- pick a design method
- try it out on your pet project
- document it! write up what you did
 - what I did
 - what I learned
 - what I was suprised by
 - what I'd do next time
