101 Design Methods, Vijay Kumar
I really don't like most of this guy's content, and the tone is very corporatey 'how to drive innovation in your organization'. But here are some methods we should cover!

I do like his iterative model of the quadrants and pathways, kind of.

1.2 popular media scan (read the internet)
2.7 Analogous Models
2.8 Competitors / Complementors
2.12 SME interview
4.15 user groups definition (basically real-people-driven personas)

5.4 Persona definition
