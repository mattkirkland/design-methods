              <h1>Your Notebook</h1>
              <p>Throughout the semester you're going to compile a design notebook. Think of this like a design playground, or a Lab Workbook, or a Design Diary. This will be a place to reflect on the week's activity and write about testing out the new UX design methods. You'll have a single project to work on, and you'll record updates in your notebook.</p>

              <p>We'll make a shared spreadsheet with everyone's links, or post them here.</p>

              <p>Your notebook is a chance to practice working in public; the stakes couldn't be lower. Your notebook URL will be shared with the class and so we can learn from each other's experiences testing out UX design methods. It should also be a nice 'practice' case study for your portfolio: any employer will be impressed to see you think through a single problem using a bunch of different methods, and documenting your process.</p>

              <p>We'll set up the notebooks in Week 2.</p>

            <div  class="section">

              <h2>Your Project</h2>

              <p>The Notion Notebook / Lab Workbook / Design Diary / Etc. is a diary of developing your Pet Project. The Pet Project can be anything, as long as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>it has an identifiable group of users (that aren't you)</li>
                <li>and you're willing to think about it for a semester.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That means it could be anything you're interested in. It could be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a better organizational system for your pokemon cards</li>
                <li>a book review site that's for a closed circle of friends</li>
                <li>a new app to guide museum visitors around the Spencer</li>
                <li>a refrigerated case for your fancy cheese collection</li>
                <li>a bag to organize knitting supplies</li>
                <li>a series of posters to convince people to take some political action</li>
                <li>wayfinding signage for your favorite sports facility / museum / campus</li>
                <li>a guidebook to teach others how to make protest infrastructure</li>
                <li>a new board game</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It doesn't have to be a NEW idea or something that's never been done.  In fact, it's probably better if it's something that exists: you shouldn't try to invent a new wheel. It just needs to be interesting (to YOU) and have a set of potential *users* that it could serve. (You can't do User Experience design without *users.*)</p>
              <p>**An important note** about designing your project: we don't really care so much what the final design of your project might look like - in fact, we won't even get to a state where we'll call it 'final.' Instead, <strong>we only care about process</strong> - this Notebook is a <em>playground</em> to test out design methods.</p>
              <p>Choose your project before or during WEEK 2. <strong>You should know it by September 3</strong>.</p>



                --------------
              <h3>Format</h3>

              <p>Your notebook is going to be completed in <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, an online note-taking / publishing system. You can use the free version, which makes it really easy to take notes and publish your pages. This is used by a growing number of designers and especially people in the digital world. At the end of the semester, you can export this out of notion and use it someplace else if you want to.</p>
              <p>Here's a template. You can go here and duplicate this notebook to get started.</p>

              <p>A few weeks will have specific prompts to fill out when we cover special topics. In the other ones, you'll follow this format:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pick a UX design method we covered this week</li>
                <li>Try it out on your pet project</li>
                <li>Document it! write up what you did</li>
                <li>What I did</li>
                <li>What I learned</li>
                <li>What I was suprised by</li>
                <li>What I'd do next time</li>
                <li>etcetera
              </ul>
