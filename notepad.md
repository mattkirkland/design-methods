## Matt's ongoing notes

###  3/20/20:
Amy Ko's got a book online here that looks great. It's even on github!
https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/index.html
I really like this outline AND it's well written; this might be a great framing for the course. https://github.com/amyjko/design-methods

###  5/13/20:
Just putting it in writing that this course plan will need to be structured for online delivery as well as an in-person lecture hall.

###  6/15/20:
Confirmed by Jeremy Shellhorn, likely plan for this to be all online.  How do we make it engaging and useful?

- can they tackle a personal project and apply these tools to a single project all the way through? MAYBE?
- can we allow all their work to be submitted and tracked online?
- feels like a way to dogfood the Institute or Badge platform :)

*Title lectures / components with outcomes and new skills in mind.*  What is a student going to GET out of this?

###  7/1/20:
Each class session can just be a design method! One per class, an intro to 26 new design methods. Maybe?

Scheduling: Class is 75 minutes, Tue/Thur! 13 weeks in new structure, ish, so 27 sessions?

This is 13 weeks, so we can do 3 sections of 4 weeks: inspiration/ideation/implementation or look/understand/make ?  Or better yet, get some of the iteration built in, some kind of look / design / test / design / test etc.

### 7/6/20:
 grab content from my Fed Talk: https://github.com/brandnewbox/fed-talks/blob/master/TwoDesignToolkits.pdf

### 7/6/20:
some notes from twitter about online formatting:
"Combine asynchronous material (available for only 1 week to avoid binging) and interactive live sessions - have them hand in homework weekly via your online learning environment and cite their homework (anonymously) in live sessions to keep them motivated." https://twitter.com/thijsporck/status/1280144091469185025

Could I imagine a format where each week (class?) there is a homework thing that is verifiable online, and GTAs just mark done/not done for each assignment? Then ask them to flag up to me any interesting or good responses, and we look at those each week?

Keep a spreadsheet online of all the homework done/not done stuff.

OVERVIEW: should I structure this in an iterative way, rather than learn/make/test?
Like, they could apply all of these to a single project with increasing fidelity and actually make a project better?   Or at least circle thru the

### 7/7/20:
Arranged some methods into my general outline. Synthesized Luma book structure into my own.

### 7/20/20:
OK, so I am strongly leaning towards having the students pick out a pet design project, and write a 'lab notebook' in Notion. It can be a place they reflect on the week's activity and write about testing out some method on their project.

By the end of the semester they'll have an overview of a bunch of new methods they have learned about and tested, and written about.
It could be a great portfolio piece? Plus they can export it to HTML, PDF, text.

STRONGLY leaning to this.
Then Me and a TA (if any) can just check the lab notebook each week and just mark yes/no if they've done the work. I... kind of love it?  Done = full points. Not done = no points. Late = no points.

Pat recommends: they'll definitely need a prompt to help some students get started.

- pick a design method
- try it out on your pet project
- document it! write up what you did
  - what I did
  - what I learned
  - what I was suprised by
  - what I'd do next time

### QUESTIONS FOR 🐚📯
- should i get started with KU as official staff?
  - like, i need to get hired as a lecturer again presumably?
  - yup, applied on 7/20/20
- he said that this could have TAs. What's that process?
  - he doesn't know, he will check on hiring one or looking at students?
- do they have other guidance for instructors?
  - 7/20/20 not really, 100% online/remote, seems like it's pretty hands-off
- when do i see class roster?
  - got it, now inside https://sa.ku.edu/

### 7/21/20
I like the general outline here but IF we are going to have students do a pet project all the way with something they workshop in a lab notebook, then... probably the class should be arranged more iteratively - so they can get into a cycle of design > test > design > test.

The Notion Notebook / Lab Workbook / Design Diary /  is a diary of developing your Pet Project. The pet project can be anything, as long as you're interested in it, it has an identifiable group of users (that aren't you), and you're willing to think about it for a semester. Could be:

- a better organizational system for your pokemon cards
- a book review site that's for a closed circle of friends
- a new app to guide museum visitors around the Spencer
- a refrigerated case for my cheese collection
- a bag to organize knitting supplies
- a series of posters to convince people to take some political action
- wayfinding signage for your favorite sports facility / museum / campus
- a guidebook to teach others how to make protest infrastructure
- that board game you've been wanting to make

It doesn't have to be a NEW idea or something that's never been done. You just are going to need to be interested in it!

MK: make an example copy that they can duplicate and then fill out.

### 8/3/20
OK, definitely going to go with the structure of:
- pick a pet project
- once per week you write up how you tested out one of the methods that we covered that weeks
- we review questions and
- that's the only homework
- by the end of the semester you can have a nice portfolio of miniature casestudies
- the final will be a real test covering basic information about what design methods are.

SO.
- make a questions form for feedback, etc, dump into a spreadsheet
- set up form for basic information? name, preferred name, email, anything you want me to know about you, etc?
- start finding async videos/resources for each method. Each intro day should have a lecture-based 'this is what this is' and a bibliography of resources to read/watch/follow.


CLASS STRUCTURE:

0-5. Warmup. QOTD. some kind of engaging thing, Matt Web waving fast or slow.
5-15. Review interesting notes/highlights from student notion journals, drive home patterns
15-45. New content, lecture. Do I want more time?
45-60. Point to online resources for more. Talk about applying
60-75. Questions?

### 8/5/20
So, structure for daily class is probs OK. Now to organize the content week-by-week.
And then fill out content for each week. And then make sample notion notebook to follow.


For each week, attempt using one (or more) methods on your pet project.
- what I did (what method is this?)
- describe how you did it
- show some documentation (a photo, a video, an artifact, etc)
- what I learned about my project
- Questions I had about this method (was it OK to _____? should I have _____? What am I supposed to do when _____ happens?)

They need to have this done by Tuesday at 8am. If it's not done, no questions asked, you just don't get credit for it. No questions asked, no excuses.

Want to make it up? Do a book report on one of matt's 'books every designer should read' and post it on your notion. Email matt to tell me you did it.  (matt make list)

Maybe the time class breakdown is more like:
- TUE:
  30min review from last week (call out notion examples, etc)
  45min lecture on new topic
- THU:
  15min recap on new topic
  15min point to online resources
  30min talk about how to apply methods
  15min questions
