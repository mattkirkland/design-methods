## Matt's ongoing notes

###  3/20/20:
Amy Ko's got a book online here that looks great. It's even on github!
https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/index.html
I really like this outline AND it's well written; this might be a great framing for the course. https://github.com/amyjko/design-methods

###  5/13/20:
Just putting it in writing that this course plan will need to be structured for online delivery as well as an in-person lecture hall.

###  6/15/20:
Confirmed by Jeremy Shellhorn, likely plan for this to be all online.  How do we make it engaging and useful?

- can they tackle a personal project and apply these tools to a single project all the way through? MAYBE?
- can we allow all their work to be submitted and tracked online?
- feels like a way to dogfood the Institute or Badge platform :)

*Title lectures / components with outcomes and new skills in mind.*  What is a student going to GET out of this?

###  7/1/20:
Each class session can just be a design method! One per class, an intro to 26 new design methods. Maybe?

Scheduling: Class is 75 minutes, Tue/Thur! 13 weeks in new structure, ish, so 27 sessions?

This is 13 weeks, so we can do 3 sections of 4 weeks: inspiration/ideation/implementation or look/understand/make ?  Or better yet, get some of the iteration built in, some kind of look / design / test / design / test etc.

### 7/6/20:
 grab content from my Fed Talk: https://github.com/brandnewbox/fed-talks/blob/master/TwoDesignToolkits.pdf

### 7/6/20:
some notes from twitter about online formatting:
"Combine asynchronous material (available for only 1 week to avoid binging) and interactive live sessions - have them hand in homework weekly via your online learning environment and cite their homework (anonymously) in live sessions to keep them motivated." https://twitter.com/thijsporck/status/1280144091469185025

Could I imagine a format where each week (class?) there is a homework thing that is verifiable online, and GTAs just mark done/not done for each assignment? Then ask them to flag up to me any interesting or good responses, and we look at those each week?

Keep a spreadsheet online of all the homework done/not done stuff.

OVERVIEW: should I structure this in an iterative way, rather than learn/make/test?
Like, they could apply all of these to a single project with increasing fidelity and actually make a project better?   Or at least circle thru the

### 7/7/20:
Arranged some methods into my general outline. Synthesized Luma book structure into my own.

### QUESTIONS FOR üêöüìØ
- should i get started with KU as official staff?
  - like, i need to get hired as a lecturer again presumably?
  - yup, applied on 7/20/20
- he said that this could have TAs. What's that process?
  - he doesn't know, he will check on hiring one or looking at students?
- do they have other guidance for instructors?
  - 7/20/20 not really, 100% online/remote, seems like it's pretty hands-off
- when do i see class roster?
  - got it, now inside https://sa.ku.edu/
